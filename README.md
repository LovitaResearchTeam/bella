## Fetching Data

### Collecting Information for New NFT Collections

To gather information for a new NFT collection, you can use the `contract_crawler.py` script. This script requires the minter and collection addresses as arguments. 

For example, to collect data for "The Ninjas" collection, you would use:

```bash
python contract_crawler.py inj1rlyp66l2macpfqer2tg57a6alvgv7ydvrlfwrh inj19ly43dgrr2vce8h02a8nw0qujwhrzm9yv8d75c
```

### Fetching Rarity Data

Once the collection data has been gathered, you can use the `ranker.py` script to calculate the rarity rankings:

```bash
python ranker.py
```

### Running the Bot

To start the bot, use the `bot.py` script. You need to provide your API token as an argument:

```bash
python bot.py <api_token>
```
